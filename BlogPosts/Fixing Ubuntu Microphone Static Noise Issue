# Fixing Ubuntu Microphone Static Noise Issue

I had the problem with my microphone working on Ubuntu 20.04. There was a constant static noise in the background, and it was causing the problems
during the onlnine meetings. 

After some investigation I found out that the problem was caused by a power-saving mode settings.

Power-saving modes on all peripherals are enabled by default to conserve battery on laptops and other battery-dependent systems. 
While it doesn't affect the system performance, there can be side effects, a good example of which is a malfunctioning audio device.

## Disable Power Saving Mode in snd_hda_intel

Step 1: Check if the power-saving mode is enabled on **snd_hda_intel**:

```
cat /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save

```
If the command returns 1, it means that the power-saving mode is on, and we need to change it to 0

Step 2: Turning off power-saving mode on **snd_hda_intel**:

```
sudo su
echo 0 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save 
```

This it! After that the static noise in the background disappeared.
